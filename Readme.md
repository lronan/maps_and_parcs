# Maps and parcellations commonly used
This repo will contain fsaverage files and annotations for commonly used parcellations and mappings as well as code to transfer between format and maps. It will also include spherical rotations that can be used to generate null distribution that retain topological coherence


## Included parcellations

### Human Connectome Parcellations (Glasser)

### Schaeffer 200

### Schaeffer 400

### 308

### 


## Included tissue classification maps

### Mesulam classes

### Von Economo classes


## Included reference maps

### Cortical expansion

### BigBrain thickness and density

# Code

## support functions

#### Nearest neighbour interpolation between maps and parcellations
To convert between fsaverage parcellations

#### Parcellate image
To parcellate an input image into a given parcellation

#### Civet to freesurfer conversion
